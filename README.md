## Process 

* Overview: This project utilizes PgAdmin 4, a graphical user interface for PostgreSQL, to build a robust music database and retrieve insights through structured queries.

* Database Creation:
I began by designing the database using an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to outline the structure. Once the schema was established, I imported the relevant CSV files into their corresponding tables, allowing me to familiarize myself with the dataset.

* Data Integration:
After importing the data, I connected the tables using Primary and Foreign Key constraints to ensure referential integrity. This step was crucial in creating a cohesive database structure that facilitates efficient querying.

* Querying for Insights:
With the database set up, I leveraged my querying skills to extract meaningful insights and answer key questions related to the music data.
